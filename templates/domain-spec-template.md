## 1. Domain Overview

**Bounded Context (owns):**  
[What this domain is responsible for — expressed as data and operations it controls]

**Bounded Context (does NOT own):**  
[Explicit exclusions — what adjacent domains handle]

**Domain Events Published:**  
[Key events this domain emits that other domains may consume]

---

## 2. Shared Models

These models are available to all products in this domain. Products must use them — not redefine them.

```typescript
// [SharedModelName — e.g., TaxForm]
interface [SharedModelName] {
  [field]: [type];     // [description]
  [field]: [type];     // [description]
}

// [SharedModelName — e.g., FilerInfo]
interface [SharedModelName] {
  [field]: [type];     // [description]
}
```

---

## 3. Domain Constraints

Every product spec in this domain must comply with these rules:

- [ ] [e.g., All monetary values stored in cents (integer), never floating point]
- [ ] [e.g., Every payload must include a `taxYear: number` field]
- [ ] [e.g., TIN values must be masked in all logs — never stored in plaintext]
- [ ] [e.g., All forms must pass IRS schema validation before being persisted]
