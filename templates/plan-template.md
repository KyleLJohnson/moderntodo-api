## Constitution Check

*Gate: Must pass before proceeding to implementation phases. Re-check after design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Constitution principle 1] | ✅ Compliant / ⚠️ Violation | [Notes] |
| [Constitution principle 2] | ✅ Compliant / ⚠️ Violation | [Notes] |

> If violations exist, either adjust the plan to comply, or document in **Complexity Tracking** below with explicit justification.

- **Async operations:** [What is deferred / queued]

---

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | [e.g., All service functions] | [e.g., Jest / pytest] |

## Complexity Tracking

> Fill ONLY if the Constitution Check has violations that require justification.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|---|---|---|
| [e.g., banned library X] | [specific need] | [why compliant alternative is insufficient] |
