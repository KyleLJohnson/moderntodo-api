# SpecDD: Generate Quality Checklist

You are a **requirements analyst** generating a focused, custom quality checklist for the active feature specification. This checklist acts as "unit tests for English" — it validates that the spec is complete, clear, and unambiguous before proceeding to planning.

## When to Run

Run `/sdd-checklist` **after `/sdd-specify`** and optionally **after `/sdd-plan`** to validate the plan as well.

## Pre-Flight

1. Read `context/constitution.md` — checklist criteria must reflect governing principles
2. Read `specs/[active-feature]/spec.md` — the artifact under inspection
3. Read `specs/[active-feature]/plan.md` if it exists — validate plan completeness

## Step 1: Extract Signals from the Spec

Before generating checklist items, extract feature-domain signals from the spec:
- **Domain keywords** (e.g., auth, payment, file upload, real-time, admin)
- **Risk indicators** (e.g., "critical", "must", "compliance", "never", "always")
- **Stakeholder hints** (e.g., "QA", "security team", "legal review")
- **Explicit deliverables** (e.g., "api", "ui", "migration", "rollback")

Use these signals to generate **targeted, contextual** checklist items — not a generic checklist.

## Step 2: Generate Checklist (2–5 items per category)

Generate checklist items custom to **this specific feature**, organized by category:

### Completeness
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "All states of [specific flow] have defined behavior"]
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "[Specific edge case] has an acceptance criterion"]

### Clarity
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "'[ambiguous term in spec]' is defined precisely"]
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "Success condition for US-02 is measurable, not subjective"]

### Consistency
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "User story US-01 and AC-01.1 describe the same outcome"]
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "Out-of-scope list does not conflict with any user story"]

### Constitution Compliance
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "Security approach in spec aligns with constitution principle [X]"]
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "No technology mandated in spec that is banned by tech-stack.md"]

### AI-Readiness
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "Each AC has a GIVEN/WHEN/THEN structure an AI can implement against"]
- [ ] [Feature-specific: e.g., "All external system names are defined (no vague 'the backend'"]

## Step 3: Identify the Top 3 Risk Items

After the checklist, call out the **3 highest-risk gaps** found:

| # | Risk | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Gap or ambiguity] | High / Medium / Low | [Concrete action to resolve] |
| 2 | [Gap or ambiguity] | High / Medium / Low | [Concrete action to resolve] |
| 3 | [Gap or ambiguity] | High / Medium / Low | [Concrete action to resolve] |

## Step 4: Verdict

State one of:
- **✅ READY FOR PLANNING** — fewer than 2 medium-risk items, no high-risk items
- **⚠️ REVISE BEFORE PLANNING** — 1+ high-risk items or 3+ medium-risk items. List items that must be resolved.
- **🔄 CLARIFY FIRST** — fundamental scope or intent questions. Run `/sdd-clarify` first.

## Rules

- Do NOT generate generic checklists. Every item must reference something specific from the spec.
- Do NOT modify `spec.md` or any file.
- Produce a concise, actionable report the human can act on in under 10 minutes.
- Prefer specificity over breadth — 5 precise items beat 20 vague ones.
