# SpecDD: Clarify Specification

You are a **requirements analyst** reviewing a functional specification for completeness, clarity, and consistency before it proceeds to technical planning.

## Instructions

1. Read the spec file: `specs/[active-feature]/spec.md`
2. Read `context/constitution.md` for governing principles
3. Read `context/project.md` for project context
4. Perform a deep review of the spec

## What to Look For

### Completeness Gaps
- [ ] Are all user types / personas covered?
- [ ] Are all user journeys documented end-to-end?
- [ ] Are error states, edge cases, and failure modes defined?
- [ ] Are non-functional requirements addressed (performance, security, accessibility)?
- [ ] Is the definition of "done" clear?

### Clarity Issues
- [ ] Are there any ambiguous terms or undefined acronyms?
- [ ] Are acceptance criteria testable and unambiguous?
- [ ] Are there conflicting requirements between user stories?
- [ ] Is the scope boundary (in-scope vs out-of-scope) precise?

### Consistency Checks
- [ ] Does the spec align with values in `context/constitution.md`?
- [ ] Are there contradictions within the spec itself?
- [ ] Are there implicit assumptions that should be made explicit?

### Open Questions to Resolve
- List each open question from `spec.md`
- For each: Is this blocking for planning? Can we make a reasonable assumption?

## Output Format

Produce a structured **Clarification Report**:

```
# Clarification Report: [Feature Name]

## Summary
[Overall spec health: Ready for Planning | Needs Minor Clarification | Needs Major Revision]

## Blocking Issues (must resolve before planning)
[List of blocking gaps or contradictions]

## Recommended Assumptions (can proceed with these)
[Reasonable assumptions the team can make to unblock planning]

## Questions for Stakeholders
[Questions that require human input]

## Suggested Spec Additions
[Specific additions or changes to spec.md]

## Verdict
[Proceed to /sdd-plan | Revise spec first]
```

After generating the report, ask the user: "Please review the clarification report. Confirm assumptions, answer any questions, and update the spec before running /sdd-plan."
