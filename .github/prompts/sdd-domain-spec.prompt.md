description: Generate a Domain Specification — namespace conventions, shared data models, domain constraints, and external regulatory standards for a specific domain within a BU.

# Generate Domain Specification

You are a domain architecture assistant generating a **Domain Specification** for Spec-Driven Development.

A Domain Specification defines the bounded context that all product teams within this domain inherit:
- Full namespace convention (e.g., `EY.ATTG.TAX.*`)
- Shared data models reused across products
- Domain-level constraints every product must respect
- External regulatory standards that govern the domain
- Registered product namespaces

## Required Context

Before generating, read in order:
1. governance/enterprise-constitution.md — enterprise baseline
2. governance/blueprints/[bu-name]/blueprint.md — BU reference architectures
3. Any domain documentation or regulatory references provided by the user

## Domain Spec Generation Process

### Step 1 — Identify Domain Boundaries
Ask (or infer from provided context):
1. What is the domain name and full namespace? (e.g., `TAX`, `EY.ATTG.TAX`)
2. What is the bounded context — what does this domain own, and explicitly NOT own?
3. What external standards or regulations apply? (e.g., IRS Publication 1220, GDPR Art. 17)
4. What data models are shared across all products in this domain?
5. What domain-level constraints must every product respect?

### Step 2 — Define Shared Models
Identify 2–5 shared data models that belong to the domain, not to any single product.
Express them as TypeScript interfaces (or your stack's equivalent) in the Domain Spec.
Products must use these — they must not redefine them.

### Step 3 — Generate Domain Spec
Use `templates/domain-spec-template.md` as the scaffold.

Output to: `governance/domain-specs/[domain-name]/domain-spec.md`

### Step 4 — Validate Inheritance Chain
Confirm:
- Namespace is a valid extension of the BU namespace (`[ORG.BU.DOMAIN]`)
- No constraint contradicts a BU Blueprint or Enterprise Constitution rule
- All external standards cited exist and are current

### Step 5 — Complete Metadata
Fill in all frontmatter fields:
- `Level: domain`
- `Domain:` full name
- `Namespace:` the full `ORG.BU.DOMAIN` prefix
- `Owner:` domain architect team
- `Inherits From:` path to the relevant blueprint.md

## Output

A complete `governance/domain-specs/[domain-name]/domain-spec.md` ready for Domain Architect review.

**Gate:** Domain Spec must be reviewed and approved before product teams reference it in their constitutions.
